Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset

NOTE 1: Full ratings file could not be used as the vector memory was getting exhausted on the local machine.

NOTE 2: the application could not render "Top 10 Similar movies" based on the movie selected, as per item to item collaborative filtering, due to large processing time. However, the code is included in the main file
